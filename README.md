# parsers_and_small-utils

Some parsers and small utilities that I wrote for our DBA

## Motivation

Our DBA needed some help with parsing logs or some little utilities for gathering reports. Some logs were hundreds of megabytes in size
and the parsers were very vaulable for timesaving. I'm glad that we were able to work together and that I that provided timesaving value
to his position and ultimately to our company.
